Based on the generator at: https://pacomiscelaneousstuff.blogspot.com/2019/08/treasure-generator.html
This is a simple treasure generator, currently it creates random pieces of jewelry, clothes, weapons, armours and other things you could find adventuring in the Old World (the plan is to make it more flexible and with a larger set of items).
